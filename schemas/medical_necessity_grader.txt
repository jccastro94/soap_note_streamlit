The patient must have a significant health problem in the form of a neuromusculoskeletal condition necessitating treatment, and the manipulative services rendered must have a direct therapeutic relationship to the patient’s condition and provide reasonable expectation of recovery or improvement of function.
The patient must have a subluxation of the spine as demonstrated by x-ray or physical examination, as described above.
Most spinal joint problems fall into the following categories:
- Acute subluxation-A patient’s condition is considered acute when the patient is being treated for a new injury, identified by x-ray or physical examination as specified above. The result of chiropractic manipulation is expected to be an improvement in, or arrest of progression, of the patient’s condition.
- Chronic subluxation-A patient’s condition is considered chronic when it is not expected to significantly improve or be resolved with further treatment (as is the case with an acute condition); however, the continued therapy can be expected to result in some functional improvement. Once the clinical status has remained stable for a given condition, without expectation of additional objective clinical improvements, further manipulative treatment is considered maintenance therapy and is not covered.
You must place the HCPCS modifier AT on a claim when providing active/corrective treatment to treat acute or chronic subluxation. However, the presence of the HCPCS modifier AT may not in all instances indicate that the service is reasonable and necessary.
As shown in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, Section 240, the doctor of chiropractic should be afforded the opportunity to effect improvement or arrest or retard deterioration in such condition within a reasonable and generally predictable period of time. Acute subluxation (for example, strains or sprains) problems may require as many as three months of treatment but some require very little treatment. In the first several days, treatment may be quite frequent but decreasing in frequency with time or as improvement is obtained.
Chronic spinal joint condition implies, of course, the condition has existed for a longer period of time and that, in all probability, the involved joints have already “set” and fibrotic tissue has developed. This condition may require a longer treatment time, but not with higher frequency.

The form must have:
a.	Review of chief complaint
b.	Changes since last visit
c.	Systems review if relevant
